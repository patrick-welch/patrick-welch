# 👋 Hi, I'm Patrick Welch

I'm a working **Microsoft .NET Architect and Line-of-Business Developer**, and a part-time **Computer Science student at CSU**, graduating in **2027** (maybe sooner). I'm currently focused on **FPGA development**, **embedded systems**, **digital logic**, and open hardware — with a stretch goal of exploring **ASIC design**.

My projects combine HDL, embedded C, and RISC-V architecture — with a strong emphasis on **retro computing**, **simulation**, and **real-world prototyping**.

## 🚀 Current Areas of Focus

### 🧠 FPGA & HDL Design
- Developing HDL projects in **Vivado** using the **Basys 3**
- Creating custom RISC-V SoCs using **PicoRV32** and **VexRiscv**
- Using **Verilator** and **VS Code** for simulation and testbench development
- Exploring **HLS** with **Vitis HLS**, following  
  _**Guide to Computer Processor Architecture: A RISC-V Approach with High-Level Synthesis**_ by Bernard Goossens (Springer)

### 💻 Embedded & RISC-V Systems
- Building RISC-V firmware in **C** for both **softcores** and **native hardware**
- Using **Ubuntu VMs** configured for cross-compilation from Goossens’ book  
  - Final project: A RISC-V softcore SoC on the **Basys 3**  
  - Contributing updated build scripts to the author’s GitHub repo
- Running **Debian on VisionFive 2**, using it as a target for cross-compiled ELF binaries

### 🧬 ASIC Design (Stretch Goal)
- Exploring **OpenLane**, **Sky130**, and **TinyTapeout** to better understand ASIC toolchains
- Synthesizing RTL blocks like UARTs, ALUs, and FSMs
- While not targeting physical design roles, these projects deepen my knowledge and position me for:
  - FPGA/RTL roles
  - Embedded validation
  - Pre-silicon testing and SoC testbench development

### 🕹️ Retro Hardware
- Exploring **Atari 68K machines**: ST, Mega ST, STe, TT, and Falcon — both the actual hardware and HDL-based reimplementations
- Reverse engineering **legacy logic chips** (GALs, GLUE logic, MMU, etc.) and prototyping HDL recreations
- Studying HDL reimplementation efforts such as **Suska**, especially now that **Falcon-compatible cores** are emerging
- Watching PCB remake boards like the **Exxos H5** (Atari ST revival) for possible builds
- *(Known as **MEX68KECB** on Atari forums)*

### 🔌 Electronics
- I have a **Hewlett-Packard and Agilent test equipment acquisition problem 😅**
- I do my best to **repair and preserve** the legacy of Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard
- These instruments are **art-pieces** to me — worthy of restoration and respect

## 🛠️ Toolchain & Hardware

- 💻 **Tools**: Vivado, Visual Studio, VS Code, Verilator, GTKWave, OpenLane, Vitis HLS
- 🧱 **Boards on Hand**:
  - Digilent **Basys 3** (Artix-7 FPGA)
  - Microchip **PolarFire SoC Discovery Kit** (RISC-V core on a locked FPGA fabric)
  - StarFive **VisionFive 2** (RISC-V SBC, Debian)
  - Terasic **DE10-Nano** (MiSTer-only setup)
- 📦 **Open Source Flows** (planned for Lattice development): `yosys`, `nextpnr`, `openFPGALoader`

## 🧑‍💻 Repositories You’ll Find Here

- [`soft-mmu-68k`](https://github.com/patrick-welch/soft-mmu-68k) — WIP Open-source Motorola 68k-compatible PMMU (68851/68030-style) in Verilog, with the goal of eventually driving physical DRAM

## ⚡ Electron Pushers

I publish my hardware projects under the **Electron Pushers** identity — a retro-inspired, Gen X-rooted banner for experimental digital design, analog angst, and modern tech that respects the signal.

> ⚛️ *Electron Pushers: Let the current flow.*

🧰 Built on:
- A love for **retro computing** (Atari ST, Falcon, Amiga)
- A passion for **FPGA & ASIC design**
- A belief that **hardware is art**, and **open tools are power**
